IDLE
LD
INC
WAIT_IN - state to wait for valid_in (input word ready) if neccesary. Unlikely as input has at least 4 cycles to prepare new word.
LD_FINAL - reset word register instead of loading to ensure zeros for final packet out if neccesary. Also assert eop_out.


keep data_load asserted in idle state so no latency to first packet out when sop_in is asserted. More power consumption in idle?
figure out count threshold to load new word on correct cycle. this is transition INC->LD
threshold for count comparison can be LUT for speed increase if this is critical path in state machine.

Could not register data_in. Would require trusting data_in, potential speed penalty if any delay in delivery of data_in. Would require different logic for zero bits on last packet out if necessary.
